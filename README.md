# Balanced Binary Search Tree

 Type | Generate tree | Search | Delete
======|===============|========|========
 Min  | 258           | 1      | 4
 Max  | 414           | 8      | 8
 Mean | 321           | 6      | 6

For Search/Delete operations it is in the line with `O log(n)` 

# Counting sort

This algorithm is less efficient when many different elements are present in an array.
